    <h1>This is my blog heading using element h1. You can also use h1-h6 the higher the number the smaller the text. Also anything after six doesn't exist and makes it the size of paragraph text.</h1>
    <!--Here we have an HTML comment element which is not displayed on the browser-->
    <h1>Check this text out</h1>
    <p>
        Here we have a paragraph.
        <br>
        <strong>Nested inside paragraph is strong element which makes text bold.</strong>
        <br>
        <em>Another nested element is em which emphasizes text by making it italic.</em>
        <br>
        Between each sentence we have a br element which separates each sentence from the previous.
